#ATARIPAC128

This is a clone of the ATARI 2600 cartridge version of PAC-MAN for the Commodore 128.  
It started as just some testing on game mechanics. I decided it would be interesting
and educational to learn about game programming for the underdeveloped C128. 

Its a work in progress, but perhaps the code will help someone else.  Enjoy!
